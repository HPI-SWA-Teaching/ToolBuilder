(name 'ToolBuilder-Morphic-ar.21'message '- integrate http://bugs.impara.de/view.php?id=55220005522: ToolBuilderSpec help support restricted to tree, menu item, and button specs.Only PluggableMenuItemSpec, PluggableTreeSpec, and PluggableButtonSpec classes have a instvar #help with accessors and corresponding buildWith: handler method that provide help-text rendering. This should be generalized to any element and rendered wherever possible.Attached is a suggested changeset for refactoring the instvar and accessors up to the generic ToolBuilderSpec class, as well as adding a generic handler for setting the balloon text for Morphic UI specs. I cannot say how well this will work for Tweak, but I imagine it is not difficult.'id '26090cf5-9f03-124d-a828-f620de25e548'date '26 November 2006'time '4:22:43 pm'author 'ar'ancestors ((id 'c2907efe-3a04-ea46-b460-b7a67c68ec54'))stepChildren ())
